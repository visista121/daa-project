Rat Maze Problem

This application returns the number of possible ways in which a rat to reach it's destination through the maze with traps in it and also returns 
least path cost to reach the destination. This appliction is entirely based on Dynamic Programming. I used Tabulation method to reduce time 
and time complexity.
